# MNIST CNN Inference with ONNX

This project trains a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the MNIST dataset, exports the model to ONNX, and runs inference using ONNX Runtime.

## 📁 Contents
- `Code0.ipynb` – Colab notebook for training and exporting the model
- `mnist_cnn.onnx` – Exported ONNX model
- `AI_Project_Summary.pdf` – Plain-language summary of the whole project
- `inference_test.py` – Python script to test the ONNX model
- `requirements.txt` – Required Python packages

## 🚀 Try It Yourself
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python inference_test.py
